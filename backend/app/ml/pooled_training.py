"""Pool many years of paired training data without ever holding more than one year's
full-width frame resident at once.

Why this exists
----------------
`_build_paired_in_chunks` builds ONE frame spanning every requested year at once, and
`full_retrain`'s `tr`/`va`/`te` are further `.copy()`'d subsets of it - so training on N
years costs memory proportional to N, and even 3 years does not fit in 23.7 GB (see
docs/known-issues.md, "does more data help" entries). XGBoost's `DataIter` /
`QuantileDMatrix` external-memory interface is built for exactly this: read one batch -
here, one year - at a time, discard it, and never materialise the pooled whole.

The three global statistics every regressor and the classifier need - the member p90, the
event-level bust threshold, and the historical bust frequency by (region, season) - each
reduce to a groupby whose keys never cross a year boundary (EVENT_KEYS includes
`init_date`; `(region_id, season)` is a per-row label). So each can be computed by
streaming every cached year once, keeping only a handful of thin columns or an
already-aggregated result, and combining the per-year partial results afterward. This is
proven equal to computing them on the full concatenation, not merely an approximation -
see test_pooled_matches_full_frame_on_stats.

What still needs one year fully in memory
-------------------------------------------
Building `event_tr` needs out-of-fold regressor predictions attached to that year's own
rows, so `full_retrain_pooled` streams the cached train years a second time, one at a
time, to do that join and immediately reduce to the (much smaller) event grain before
moving to the next year. Validation and test are each a single held-out slice (the pool's
chronological tail, and one whole calendar year respectively) and are held fully in
memory throughout, matching what `full_retrain` already does for them.

Compatibility with the rest of the system
-------------------------------------------
A regressor trained via `xgb.train()` on a `QuantileDMatrix` is a `Booster`, not the
`xgb.XGBRegressor` the registry, `app.ml.inference` and `app.ml.explain` (SHAP) expect.
`_booster_to_sklearn` round-trips it through `save_model`/`load_model` - the same format
`registry.py` already persists - so every downstream consumer sees an ordinary
`XGBRegressor`/`XGBClassifier` and nothing else has to change.
